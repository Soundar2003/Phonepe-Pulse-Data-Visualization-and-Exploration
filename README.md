**Project Title:** Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration: A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly

**Technologies:** Github Cloning, Python, Pandas, MySQL, mysql-connector-python, Streamlit, and Plotly

**Domain:** Fintech

**Problem Statement:**

The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.

**Solution:**

**The solution will include the following steps:**

Extract data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository through scripting and clone it.
Transform the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps.
Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database for efficient storage and retrieval.
Create a live geo visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python to display the data in an interactive and visually appealing manner.
Fetch the data from the MySQL database to display in the dashboard.
Provide at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display on the dashboard.

**Benefits:**

**The solution will provide the following benefits:**

A user-friendly and interactive dashboard for visualizing data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository.
The ability to dynamically update the dashboard with the latest data.
Valuable insights and information about the data in the Phonepe pulse Github repository.
Learning Outcomes:

**By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience with the following:**
